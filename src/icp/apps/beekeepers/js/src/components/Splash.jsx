                    Managed honey bees and wild bees travel far from their nests to find food.
                    What are your bees experiencing during their journey? This tool will help
                    you understand how the landscape surrounding your apiary, garden, or farm
                    stacks up in terms of the floral resources bees can find, the pesticides
                    they encounter, and, for wild bees, the nesting sites that are available.
